        Jira is an issue and task management tool where the upcoming and backlog of changes, improvements and additions are managed.

The XMinds team lead creates tickets / tasks for the project and ensures they are assigned to the right people.

This helps clients' monitor the progress of deliverables anytime they want with the click of a button. Role-based security policies are also implemented to ensure that these tickets can only be viewed by pre-authorized logins.

"JIRA combines issue tracking, agile project management and a pluggable integration framework to increase the velocity of your off -‐shoring team". Within Jira,projects are often broken down into versions and every version will have a set of tasks which can then be linked to one another and can also have sub-‐tasks.

JIRA will act as the source of truth for what has been done and what still needs to be done on the project.
