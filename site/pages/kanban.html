Kanban is a concept related to lean software development methodology. Kanban is not an inventory control system. Rather, it is a scheduling system that tells you what to produce, when to produce it, and how much to produce. In Agile software development, it has become a common practice to visualize and share project status by posting cards on a wall of the project room. Kanban can be termed as typical bulletin board in similar fashion. On the board, engineering tasks are represented by cards (Post-It Notes), and the statuses are indicated by posting them to separate areas on the board labeled "ToDo", "Doing", and "Done". Such Kanban Boards helps visually signal tasks and limit WIP (Work In Progress). For each iteration, tasks are newly identified by breaking down user stories into tasks and these tasks that are posted onto the ToDo area.

The Kanban System, as applied to software development, typically proceeds by dividing the software development process into a sequence of steps; moving the story cards across a big visible board (with one column for each step); and imposing limits on the number of stories that can be "in" each step, at one time.
