        <p>
        Confluence is a Wiki-like knowledge base that stores documents and information and shares them among different stakeholders. All project requirements including drawings / wire frames will be uploaded thus enabling project transparency. Role-based security policies are implemented to ensure that these documents can only be viewed by authorized stakeholders.

Clients can access this enterprise Wiki and can upload requirements, drawings, sketches, feedbacks and artifacts related to projects. This space is organized efficiently to ensure deliverables are updated in the client space as often as possible.

We will make every effort to keep this space up-to-date and organized and will also make sure deliverables are updated in the client space as often as possible.Once we sign the service agreements, our Ops team will send you the login credentials to access your confluence space.
