MVP or Minimum Viable Product is a strategy used for fast and quantitative market testing of a product or product feature. A MVP is a strategy and process directed toward making and selling a product to customers. It is an iterative process of idea generation, prototyping, presentation, data collection, analysis and learning. In MVP, the total time spent on an iteration is minimized. The process is iterated until a desirable product-market fit is obtained, or until the product is deemed to be non-viable.
